  <h1>Dichotomous Key</h1>
  <p>Students and professionals use the dichotomous key to identify and classify objects (i.e. people, animals, plants, bacteria, etc.) into specific categories based on their characteristics. It's the most commonly used form of classification or type of identification key used in biology as it simplifies identifying unknown organisms.</p>

  These can function without an active internet connection. Just open the dichotomous key page while you do have a connection and keep using it/do not navigate or refresh from the page!</p>
  <h2>Cyprinidae Dichotomous Key</h2>
  <p>Cyprinidae is a family of freshwater fish commonly called the carp or minnow family. It includes the carps, 
  the true minnows, and relatives like the barbs and barbels.</p>
  <h2>Juvenile Salmoninae Dichotomous Key</h2>
  <p>Salmonidae is a family of ray-finned fish that constitutes the only currently extant family in the order Salmoniformes. 
  It includes salmon (both Atlantic and Pacific species), trout (both ocean-going and landlocked), chars, freshwater 
  whitefishes, graylings, taimens and lenoks, which are collectively known as the salmonids ("salmon-like fish"). 
  The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), whose Latin name became that of its genus Salmo, is also the source of the family and order names.</p>
